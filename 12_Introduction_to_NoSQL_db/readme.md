# About this Course
Get started with NoSQL Databases with this beginner-friendly introductory course! This course will provide technical, hands-on knowledge of NoSQL databases and **Database-as-a-Service (DaaS)** offerings. With the advent of Big Data and agile development methodologies, NoSQL databases have gained a lot of relevance in the database landscape. Their main advantage is the ability to handle scalability and flexibility issues modern applications raise.    

You will start this course by learning the history and the basics of NoSQL databases  (document, key-value, column, and graph) and discover their key characteristics and benefits. You will learn about the four categories of NoSQL databases and how they differ . Youâ€™ll also explore the differences between the ACID and BASE consistency models, the pros and cons of distributed systems, and when to use RDBMS and NoSQL.  You will also learn about vector databases, an emerging class of databases popular in AI. 

Next, you will explore the architecture and features of several  implementations of NoSQL databases, namely **MongoDB**, **Cassandra**, and **IBM Cloudant**. You will learn about the common tasks that they each perform and their key and defining characteristics.  

You will then get hands-on experience using those NoSQL databases to perform standard database management tasks, such as creating and replicating databases, loading and querying data, modifying database permissions, indexing and aggregating data, and sharding (or partitioning) data.  

At the end of this course, you will complete a final project where you will apply all your knowledge of the course content to a specific scenario and work with several NoSQL databases. This course suits anyone wanting to expand their Data Management and Information Technology skill set.
