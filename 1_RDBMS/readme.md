# Introduction to RDBMS

## About this Course ðŸš€

This course is designed to provide with a solid foundation in understanding how data 
is stored, processed, and accessed in relational databases (RDBMSes).

### What I Learned ðŸ§ 

- Gain insights into relational database concepts.
- Explore industry-standard RDBMSes, including:
  - IBM DB2
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL
  
- Work with RDBMS tools like phpMyAdmin and pgAdmin for creating and maintaining databases.
- Use the command line and SQL statements to create and manage tables.
- Engage in hands-on, practical exercises with real databases and explore real-world datasets.

### Course Highlights ðŸŒŸ

- **Practical Exercises:** Apply your learning through hands-on activities.
- **Database Exploration:** Work with real databases and analyze real-world datasets.
- **Final Assignment:** Apply your knowledge to design a database, normalize tables, create tables and views, and load/access data.

### Final Project

This module marks the culmination of the course, where you'll apply your acquired skills to a practical scenario. 
The project focuses on designing a database from new data, involving the creation of an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
to define entities, attributes, and relationships. The tasks include normalizing tables, database creation, data loading,
and handling views for effective database management.

#### Learning Objectives

- **Database Design Importance:** Understand the significance of a well-designed database.
- **ERD Creation:** Develop an ERD for the database, outlining entities, attributes, and relationships.
- **SQL Script Execution:** Generate and execute SQL scripts from the ERD to create a schema.
- **Data Loading:** Populate the database schema with relevant data.
- **Normalization:** Implement table normalization to enhance database structure.
- **Key and Relationship Definition:** Identify entities, attributes, define keys, and establish relationships.
- **Database Object Building:** Utilize pgAdmin ERD Tool to generate and run SQL scripts, building database objects.
- **View Management:** Create both regular and materialized views, exporting data from each.
- **Cross-Database Operations:** Import data into both Db2 and MySQL databases.
- **Peer Evaluation:** Evaluate peers' database designs and implementations using the provided rubric and grading scheme.
