# Final Project ✨

This module marks the culmination of the course, where you'll put your acquired skills to the test in a practical scenario. 
The project focuses on designing and implementing a relational database system for a thriving coffee shop chain. ☕️

## Learning Objectives 🤔

- **Database Design Importance:** Grasp the significance of a well-structured database for efficient data management, analysis, and decision-making. 🧠
- **ERD Creation:** Develop an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visually represent the relationships between entities in the database. 📐
- **SQL Script Execution:** Generate and execute SQL scripts to create the database schema, populate it with data, and perform data manipulation and analysis. ⌨️
- **Normalization:** Implement table normalization to minimize data redundancy, optimize database performance, and ensure data integrity. 💯
- **Key and Relationship Definition:** Identify entities, attributes, define primary keys, and establish relationships between entities. 🔍
- **Database Object Building:** Utilize pgAdmin ERD Tool to generate and run SQL scripts, building database objects like tables, views, and relationships. 🛠️
- **View Management:** Create both regular and materialized views to provide different perspectives on the data and summarize complex data relationships. 📄
- **Cross-Database Operations:** Import data into both Db2 and MySQL databases using appropriate data migration techniques to ensure data portability. 🌐
- **Peer Evaluation:** Evaluate peers' database designs and implementations using the provided rubric and grading scheme to enhance collaboration and learning. 🏛️

## Scenario ☕️

Embark on a journey as a Data Engineer who has just joined a New York-based coffee shop chain that's expanding nationally by opening numerous franchise locations.
As part of their expansion process, they seek to streamline operations and revamp their data infrastructure. 🏘️

Their current data resides in disparate systems: accounting software, suppliers' databases, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and even spreadsheets.
Your task is to design a relational database system to consolidate and manage this scattered data effectively. 🏚️

You'll begin by crafting an ERD to visually represent the relationships between the various entities in the database. Then, you'll generate and execute 
SQL scripts to create the tables, define the relationships between them, and load the data. 🔨

Subsequently, you'll implement normalization to ensure data consistency, eliminate redundancy, and optimize database performance. 
Finally, you'll create views to provide different perspectives on the data, export data to other RDBMS systems for further analysis,
and showcase your expertise to the client. 📊

**Software Used in This Project**
In this project, I will use:
-  PostgreSQL Database
-  IBM Db2 Database
-  MySQL
  
These are all relational database management systems (RDBMS) designed to efficiently store, manipulate, and retrieve the data.

**Data Used in This Project**
In this project, you will be working with a subset of data from the Coffee shop sample data.

You will use a modified version of the data for the project, so to succeed in the project, download the linked files when prompted in the instructions.
You do not need to use any data from the original source.

In your scenario, you will be working with data from the following sources:

- Staff information held in a spreadsheet at HQ
- Sales outlet information held in a spreadsheet at HQ
- Sales data output as a CSV file from the POS system in the sales outlets
- Customer data output as a CSV file from a bespoke customer relationship management system
- Product information maintained in a spreadsheet exported from your supplier’s database

**Objectives**
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

1. Identify entities.
2. Identity attributes.
3. Create an entity relationship diagram (ERD) using the pgAdmin ERD Tool.
4. Normalize tables.
5. Define keys and relationships.
6. Create database objects by generating and running the SQL script from the ERD Tool.
7. Create a view and export the data.
8. Create a materialized view and export the data.
9. Import data into IBM Db2 database.
10. Import data into a MySQL database.
