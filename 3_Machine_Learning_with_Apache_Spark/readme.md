# About the course
Explore the exciting world of machine learning with this IBM course. 

Start by learning ML fundamentals before unlocking the power of Apache Spark to build and deploy ML models for data engineering applications. Dive into supervised and unsupervised learning techniques and discover the revolutionary possibilities of Generative AI through instructional readings and videos.

Gain hands-on experience with Spark structured streaming, develop an understanding of data engineering and ML pipelines, and become proficient in evaluating ML models using SparkML.  

In practical labs, you'll utilize SparkML for regression, classification, and clustering, enabling you to construct prediction and classification models. Connect to Spark clusters, analyze SparkSQL datasets, perform ETL activities, and create ML models using Spark ML and sci-kit learn. Finally, demonstrate your acquired skills through a final assignment. 

This intermediate course is suitable for aspiring and experienced data engineers, as well as working professionals in data analysis and machine learning. Prior knowledge in Big Data, Hadoop, Spark, Python, and ETL is highly recommended for this course.

## Project
### Build a Machine Learning Pipeline for Airfoil Noise Prediction
You are a data engineer at an aeronautics consulting company. Your company prides itself in being able to efficiently design airfoils for use in planes and sports cars. Data scientists in your office need to work with different algorithms and data in different formats. While they are good at Machine Learning, they count on you to be able to do ETL jobs and build ML pipelines. In this project you will use the modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset. You will clean this dataset, by dropping the duplicate rows, and removing the rows with null values. You will create an ML pipeline to create a model that will predict the SoundLevel based on all the other columns. You will evaluate the model and towards the end you will persist the model.
