# ETL Process Synopsis ðŸ”„

This repository showcases an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process implemented in Python. 
The ETL process involves extracting data from various file types, transforming the data,
and loading it into a database for further processing.

## Code Overview

The code utilizes Python with libraries such as `pandas` and `xml.etree.ElementTree` for data manipulation and processing.
It demonstrates the extraction of data from CSV, JSON, and XML files, performs unit conversions, and logs the ETL process progress.

## Extract Phase

The `extract` function employs the `glob` library to identify different file types. 
It processes CSV, JSON, and XML files, creating a unified dataframe for further transformations.

## Transform Phase

The `transform` function converts units from inches/pounds to meters/kilograms, rounding off the values to two decimals.

## Load Phase

The `load_data` function writes the transformed data to a CSV file.

## Logging Progress

The ETL process progress is logged with timestamps. 
The logs include the initiation and completion of each phase: Extract, Transform, and Load.

## Execution

To run the ETL process, execute the provided Python script (`etl_process.py`). 
The progress logs are recorded in the `log_file.txt`, and the transformed data is saved to `transformed_data.csv`.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your specific ETL needs!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
