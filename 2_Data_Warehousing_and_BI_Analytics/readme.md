# About this course
Kickstart your Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence (BI) Analytics journey with this self-paced course. You will learn how to design, deploy, load, manage, and query data warehouses and data marts. You will also work with BI tools to analyze data in these repositories. 

You will begin this course by understanding different kinds of analytics repositories including data marts, data warehouses, data lakes, data lakehouses, and data reservoirs, and their functions and uses. They are designed to enable rapid business decision making through accurate and flexible reporting and data analysis. 

A data warehouse is one of the most fundamental business intelligence tools in use today, and one that successful Data Engineers must understand. In this course, you will learn to design, model and implement data warehouses and explore data-warehousing architectures such as Star and Snowflake schemas. You will also learn how to populate data warehouses using ETL and ELT processes, verify data, query data and how to use Cubes, Rollups, and materialized views/tables. 

You will become familiar with different BI tools used by experts in the industry such as IBM Cognos Analytics, Tableau, and Microsoft PowerBI. You will also use a BI tool to create data visualizations and build interactive dashboards to gain insights from data. 

The hands-on labs in this course will enable you to apply what you learn and gain a practical knowledge of Data Warehousing and BI Analytics. You will work with repositories like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and IBM Db2. You will also use BI tools like Cognos Analytics. At the end of this course, you will complete a project to demonstrate the skills you acquired in each module.
