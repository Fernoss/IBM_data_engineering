# Project Overview ðŸ“ˆ

## Instructions
Now that you are equipped with the knowledge and skills to extract, transform and load data you will use these skills to perform ETL, create a pipeline and upload the data into a database. You will use both Airflow and Kafka in the Hands-on labs.

## Scenario
You are a data engineer at a data analytics consulting company. You have been assigned to a project that aims to de-congest the national highways by analyzing the road traffic data from different toll plazas. Each highway is operated by a different toll operator with different IT setup that use different file formats.  In the first Hands-on lab your job is to collect data available in different formats and, consolidate it into a single file.  

As a vehicle passes a toll plaza, the vehicle's data like vehicle_id,vehicle_type,toll_plaza_id and timestamp are streamed to Kafka. In the second Hands-on lab your job is to create a data pipe line that collects the streaming data and loads it into a database.
